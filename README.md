                        Twinsult's main detector looks for insults in an insult dictionary. It features smart tools to
                        edit the dictionary in-program.</br>

    <h2>Project's origin</h2>
        <p>
            This project was created for CentraleSup√©lec's coding weeks, a two-week long bootcamp which aims, through the realization of computer development projects, to allow students to consolidate their knowledge in programming and development of computer applications on the one hand and on the other hand to learn about the practices and methodologies of group computer development. </br>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Root folder includes __main__.py, which is the only function you should call, a src folder which includes whole source code,
            and a tests folder. </br>
            Source follows architecture:
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    collection package: modules making requests to TwitterAPI using tweepy
                </li>
                <li>
                    data package: contains insults' dictionary and a small script to process it
                </li>
                <li>
                    GUI package: modules pertaining to the interface, using tkinter and using OOP.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Essential functional modules: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                detect.py: contains functions detecting whether tweets are insulting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                distance.py: checks if words are close to insults, which may be "filter evading".
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A couple of small, explicit scripts.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
